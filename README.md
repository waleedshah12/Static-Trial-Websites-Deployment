# Static Trial Websites Deployment

Deployed static trial websites for Corvit Institute (Peshawar \& Lahore campuses) using 2 Amazon EC2 instances. â€” all running smoothly on Apache server. We have deployed it on trial basis, as the full version is about to be deployed soon, once we finalize a new domain on ROUTE 53.



**To ensure reliability, I configured a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) to distribute traffic between instances, set up secure access rules, and monitored everything with CloudWatch.**



**This project gave me solid hands-on experience with:**

**EC2 deployment \& configuration**

**Load balancing for high availability**

**Web hosting on Amazon Linux**

**Excited to keep building bigger AWS cloud projects! ðŸš€**
